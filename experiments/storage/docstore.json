3\nExecutive Summary\nOcean and coastal ecosystems support life on Earth and many \naspects of human well-being. Covering two-thirds of the planet, \nthe ocean hosts vast biodiversity and modulates the global climate \nsystem by regulating cycles of heat, water and elements, including \ncarbon. Marine systems are central to many cultures, and they also \nprovide food, minerals, energy and employment to people. Since \nprevious assessments1, new laboratory studies, field observations \nand process studies, a wider range of model simulations, Indigenous \nknowledge, and local knowledge have provided increasing evidence \non the impacts of climate change on ocean and coastal systems, how \nhuman communities are experiencing these impacts, and the potential \nsolutions for ecological and human adaptation.\nObservations: vulnerabilities and impacts\nAnthropogenic climate change has exposed ocean and coastal \necosystems to conditions that are unprecedented over millennia \n(high confidence2), and this has greatly impacted life in the \nocean and along its coasts (very high confidence). Fundamental \nchanges in the physical and chemical characteristics of the ocean \nacting individually and together are changing the timing of seasonal \nactivities (very high confidence), distribution (very high confidence) and \nabundance (very high confidence) of oceanic and coastal organisms, \nfrom microbes to mammals and from individuals to ecosystems, \nin every region. Evidence of these changes is apparent from multi-\ndecadal observations, laboratory studies and mesocosms, as well as \nmeta-analyses of published data. Geographic range shifts of marine \nspecies generally follow the pace and direction of climate warming \n(high confidence): surface warming since the 1950s has shifted \nmarine taxa and communities poleward at an average (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0very \nlikely3 range) of 59.2\u00a0 \u00b1\u00a0 15.5 km per", "doc_id": "9d8f9b35-ac34-46ee-8168-a545ad0964f9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9d2198b4f55329ad08787b038ab000120fac2fa3b99bbb6eb711a9043d42b01e", "extra_info": {"total_pages": 172, "file_path": "./IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf", "source": "3"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1939}, "relationships": {"1": "ec1150a7-f619-4c15-a841-d33dd2ec86e1", "3": "42f45a48-2147-4880-9b75-896b1eeaf91c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "42f45a48-2147-4880-9b75-896b1eeaf91c": {"__data__": {"text": "warming \n(high confidence): surface warming since the 1950s has shifted \nmarine taxa and communities poleward at an average (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0very \nlikely3 range) of 59.2\u00a0 \u00b1\u00a0 15.5 km per decade (high confidence), \nwith substantial variation in responses among taxa and regions. \nSeasonal events occur 4.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 d to 7.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 d earlier per decade \namong planktonic organisms (very high confidence) and on average \n3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 d earlier per decade for fish (very high confidence).

We refer to these as multiple lines of evidence, meaning that the evidence comes \nfrom diverse approaches, as described below.\nEmissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from human activity cause ocean warming, acidification, oxygen \nloss, and other physical and chemical changes that are affecting marine ecosystems around the world. At the same \ntime, natural climate variability and direct human impacts, such as overfishing and pollution, also affect marine \necosystems locally, regionally and globally. These climate and non-climate impact drivers counteract each other, add \nup or multiply to produce smaller or larger changes than expected from individual drivers. Attribution of changes in \nmarine ecosystems requires evaluating the often-interacting roles of natural climate variability, non-climate drivers, \nand human-induced climate change. To do this work, scientists use\n\u2022 paleorecords: reconstructing the links between climate and evolutionary and ecological changes of the past;\n\u2022 contemporary observations: assessing current climate and ecological responses;\n\u2022 \nmanipulation experiments: measuring responses of organisms and ecosystems to different climate conditions; and\n\u2022 models: testing whether we understand how organisms and ecosystems are impacted by different stressors, and \nquantifying the relative importance of different stressors.\nPaleorecords can be used to trace the correlation between past changes in climate and marine life.

Paleoclimate is \nreconstructed from the chemical composition of shells and teeth or from sediments and ice cores.

Using large \ndatasets, we can infer the effects of climate change on sea life over relatively long time scales\u23afusually hundreds to \nmillions of years. The advantage of paleorecords is that they provide insights into how climate change affects life \nfrom organisms to ecosystems, without the complicating influence of direct human impacts. A key drawback is that \nthe paleo and modern worlds do not have fully comparable paleoclimate regimes, dominant marine species and \nrates of climate change. Nevertheless, the paleorecord can be used to derive fundamental rules by which organisms, \necosystems, environments and regions are typically most affected by climate change. For example, the paleorecord \nshows that coral reefs repeatedly underwent declines during past warming events, supporting the inference that \ncorals may not be able to adapt to current climate warming.\nContemporary observations over recent decades allow scientists to relate the status of marine species and \necosystems to changes in climate or other factors. For example, scientists compile large datasets to determine \nwhether species usually associated with warm water are appearing in traditionally cool-water areas that are rapidly \nwarming.

A key characteristic of ocean \ntemperature change relevant for ecosystems is climate velocity, a \nmeasure of the speed and direction at which isotherms move under \nclimate change (Burrows et\u00a0al., 2011), which gives the rate at which \nspecies must migrate to maintain constant climate conditions. It has \nbeen shown to be a useful and simple predictor of species distribution \nshifts in marine ecosystems (Chen et\u00a0al., 2011; Pinsky et\u00a0al., 2013; Lenoir \net\u00a0al., 2020).

Such temperature-nutrient \ninteractions might be especially relevant during summer MHWs \n(Section\u00a0 3.2.2.1; Cross-Chapter Box\u00a0 EXTREMES in Chapter\u00a0 2; IPCC, \n2018; Holbrook et\u00a0al., 2019; DeCarlo et\u00a0al., 2020; Hayashida et\u00a0al., \n2020), when primary producers are often nutrient-limited and near their \nthermal limits. Increasingly frequent and intense MHWs along with \nprojected decreases in nutrient availability (Section\u00a03.2.3.3) may push \nsome primary producers beyond tolerance thresholds. Temperature\u2013\nnutrient interactions can also alter the photosynthesis-to-respiration \nratio in phytoplankton (Mara\u00f1\u00f3n et\u00a0al., 2018).

Other influential drivers include \nocean acidification, salinity (high confidence) (Lefevre, 2016; Whiteley \net\u00a0al., 2018; Reddin et\u00a0al., 2020) or food availability/quality (medium \nconfidence) (Nagelkerken and", "doc_id": "b3ac915c-7355-4322-8324-ba573946feff", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9116773d988e0acd371386a57d57e267bff893c388d86ee9ebab1d366b5d18dd", "extra_info": {"total_pages": 172, "file_path": "./IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf", "source": "29"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1680}, "relationships": {"1": "98ccde56-ea69-4736-90a5-3c4e26d2477f", "3": "7febf181-9b0a-4064-b490-fd5634381b89"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7febf181-9b0a-4064-b490-fd5634381b89": {"__data__": {"text": "salinity (high confidence) (Lefevre, 2016; Whiteley \net\u00a0al., 2018; Reddin et\u00a0al., 2020) or food availability/quality (medium \nconfidence) (Nagelkerken and Munday, 2016; Gao et\u00a0 al., 2020). \nFluctuating and decreasing salinity may aggravate the detrimental \neffects of warming and elevated CO2, because dilution with freshwater \nlowers acid\u2013base buffering capacity, resulting in lower pH and calcium \ncarbonate saturation state (Dickinson et\u00a0al., 2012; Shrivastava et\u00a0al., \n2019; Melzner et\u00a0al., 2020).\n3.3.4 \nAcclimation and Evolutionary Adaptation\nClimate change is and will continue to be a major driver of natural \nselection, causing important changes in fitness-related (e.g., growth, \nreproduction, survival) and functional (e.g., body/cell size, morphology, \nphysiology) traits, and in the genetic diversity of natural populations \n(medium confidence) (Pauls et\u00a0 al., 2013; Meril\u00e4 and Hendry, 2014). \nClimate-change impacts will continue to be exacerbated by interactions \nwith non-climate drivers such as habitat fragmentation or loss, pollution \nor resource overexploitation, which limit the adaptive potential of \npopulations to future conditions (Trathan et\u00a0al., 2015; Gait\u00e1n-Espitia \nand Hobday, 2021).

This powerful generic experimental approach has largely been restricted to single \nspecies because it is logistically complex to conduct experiments that straddle multiple trophic levels, and that also include more than \ntwo drivers (see Figure Box\u00a03.1.1b); the need for multiple replicates, drivers and treatment levels greatly increase the work required \n(Parmesan et\u00a0al., 2013; Boyd et\u00a0al., 2018). It is challenging to apply this experimental approach to communities or ecosystems (see Figure \nBox\u00a03.1.1). To date, most research on community or ecosystem response to climate-induced drivers has been in large-volume (>10,000 l) \nmesocosms (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2014), or at natural analogues such as CO2 seeps, in which only one driver (ocean acidification) is \naltered (see (4) in Figure Box\u00a03.1.1). Only very recently have two drivers been incorporated into climate-change manipulation studies \nexamining responses of primary producers to secondary consumers (see (5) in Figure Box\u00a03.1.1a; Nagelkerken et\u00a0al., 2020).

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are extended periods of unusually warm ocean \ntemperatures relative to the typical temperatures for that location and time of\u00a0year. Due to climate change, the number of days with MHWs has \nincreased by 54% over the past century. These MHWs cause mortalities in a wide variety of marine species, from corals to kelp to seagrasses \nto fish to seabirds, and have consequent effects on ecosystems and industries like aquaculture and fisheries.\nExtreme events in the ocean can have damaging effects on marine ecosystems and the human communities that \ndepend on them. The most common form of ocean extremes are MHWs, which are becoming more frequent and \nintense due to global warming. Because seawater absorbs and releases heat more slowly than air, temperature \nextremes in the ocean are not as pronounced as over land, but they can persist for much longer, often for weeks \nto months over areas covering hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. These MHWs can be more detrimental \nfor marine species, in comparison with land species, because marine species are usually adapted to relatively stable \ntemperatures.\nA commonly used definition of MHWs is a period of at least 5\u00a0days whose temperatures are warmer than 90% \nof the historical records for that location and time of\u00a0year. Marine heatwaves are described by their abruptness, \nmagnitude, duration, intensity and other metrics.

In many regions, climate change is degrading ocean health and altering stocks of marine resources. Together with over-harvesting, \nclimate change is threatening the future of the sustenance provided to Indigenous Peoples, the livelihoods of artisanal fisheries, and \nmarine-based industries including tourism, shipping and transportation.\nThe ocean is the lifeblood of the planet. In addition to regulating planetary cycles of carbon, water and heat, \nthe ocean and its vast resources support human livelihoods, cultural practices, jobs and industries. The impacts \nof climate change on the ocean can influence human activities and employment by altering resource availability, \nspreading pathogens, flooding shorelines and degrading ocean ecosystems. Fishing and mariculture are highly \nexposed to change. The global ocean and inland waters together provide more than 3.3\u00a0billion people at least \n20% of the protein they eat and provide livelihoods for 60\u00a0million people. Changes in the nutritional quality or \nabundance of food from the oceans could influence billions of people.\nSubstantial economic losses for fisheries resulting from recent climate-driven harmful algal blooms and marine \npathogen outbreaks have been recorded in Asia, North America and South America. A 2016 event in Chile caused \nan estimated loss of 800\u00a0million USD in the farmed-salmon industry and led to regional government protests.

At the national level, ocean governance for climate-change \nadaptation is often transversal, requiring consideration of biophysical and \nenvironmental conditions (Furlan et\u00a0al., 2020) while fitting into existing \neconomic (Kim, 2020) and political processes. Adaptation governance \nthat couples existing top-down structures with decentralised and \nparticipatory approaches generates shared goals and unlocks required \nresources and monitoring (Gupta et\u00a0al., 2016; Haas et\u00a0al., 2021).\nCommunities and governments at all levels increasingly use decision-\nmaking frameworks (e.g., structured decision making) or decision-\nanalysis tools to evaluate trade-offs between different responses, \nrather than applying generic best practices to different physical, \ntechnical or cultural contexts (high confidence) (Watkiss et\u00a0al., 2015; \nHaasnoot et\u00a0al., 2019; Palutikof et\u00a0al., 2019). Increased effort has also \nbeen devoted to developing climate services (actionable information \nand data products) that bridge the gap between climate prediction \nand decision making (Hewitt et\u00a0al., 2020). Climate services have the \npotential to inform decision making related to disaster-risk reduction, \nadaptation responses, marine environmental management (e.g., \nfisheries management and MPA management) and ocean-based \nclimate mitigation (e.g., renewable-energy installations) (Le Cozannet \net\u00a0 al., 2017; Gattuso et\u00a0 al., 2019; Gattuso et\u00a0 al., 2021). Although \nimproving observational and modelling capacity is important to \ndeveloping ocean-focused services, particularly in high-risk regions \nlike SIDS where regional climate projections are scarce (WGI AR6 \nChapter\u00a0 9; Morim et\u00a0 al., 2019; Fox-Kemper et\u00a0 al., 2021), data are \nnot the only limiting factor in decision", "doc_id": "d48c2352-5ffc-4c12-a716-0b2701d2edb0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ae36171536d4cd0738065bd5eea4a69c50de745561da31e1f79644b2f22e0e8f", "extra_info": {"total_pages": 172, "file_path": "./IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf", "source": "111"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1838}, "relationships": {"1": "c4ee3107-70ed-4001-b0e3-004ad02aa964", "3": "941d96f9-d19b-4ba5-af9c-0f3ccfe39c07"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "941d96f9-d19b-4ba5-af9c-0f3ccfe39c07": {"__data__": {"text": "regional climate projections are scarce (WGI AR6 \nChapter\u00a0 9; Morim et\u00a0 al., 2019; Fox-Kemper et\u00a0 al., 2021), data are \nnot the only limiting factor in decision making (Weichselgartner and \nArheimer, 2019).

Combined solutions \nalso leverage a variety of existing policies and governance systems \n(Section\u00a03.6.4.3; Duarte et\u00a0al., 2020) to advance climate mitigation and \nadaptation. Even communities that face the limits of adaptation, like \nthose who must relocate to cope with rising seas (McMichael et\u00a0al., \n2019; Bronen et\u00a0 al., 2020), urgently require solutions that combine \nscientific projections, IKLK, cultural and community values, and ways to \npreserve cultural identity to support planning and implementation of \nrelocation (McMichael and Katonivualiku, 2020).\nNature-based solutions are showing promising results in achieving \nadaptation and mitigation outcomes across marine and coastal \necosystems (Sections\u00a0 3.6.3.2.1\u20133.6.3.2.2), but NbS have different \ndegrees of readiness in marine ecosystems (Duarte et\u00a0al., 2020).

Although most of the focus on NbS \nefficacy has been on coastal and shelf ecosystems (Section\u00a0 3.6.3.2), \nrecent advances point to an emerging role of NbS beyond coastal waters \nin the form of area-based management tools in marine areas beyond \nnational jurisdiction (Section\u00a03.6.2.3; Gaines et\u00a0al., 2018; Pinsky et\u00a0al., \n2018; Crespo et\u00a0al., 2020; O\u2019Leary et\u00a0al., 2020; Visalli et\u00a0al., 2020; Wagner \net\u00a0al., 2020), because sustainable fisheries and aquaculture and climate-\nresponsive MPAs have high potential to adapt (Tittensor et\u00a0al., 2019).\nAdaptation efforts (Sections\u00a0 3.6.3.1\u20133.6.3.2) have three common \ncharacteristics that facilitate implementation and success, and \ncontribute to climate resilient development pathways (Chapter\u00a0 18). \nFirst, availability of multiple types of information (e.g., monitoring, \nmodels, climate services; Section\u00a03.6.3.3) exposes the magnitude and \nnature of the adaptation challenge. Well-developed observation and \nmodelling capabilities (Reusch et\u00a0al., 2018) offer insights on climate-\nassociated risks at different time scales (Cvitanovic et\u00a0al., 2018; Hobday \net\u00a0 al., 2018), and this facilitates adaptation within multiple areas \n(e.g., industries over shorter time scales,", "doc_id": "7c0e16fb-1480-41a7-8265-70ed1fabf47e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e1e22c7be9d47294f1b9cff3e25ad58fa4b583ba9d0fc338d009211dfdc8194f", "extra_info": {"total_pages": 172, "file_path": "./IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf", "source": "114"}, "node_info": {"start": 3070, "end": 4602}, "relationships": {"1": "f620666c-9462-4b9f-aa54-84fafbca76ea", "2": "0f056a9f-3b43-4ae0-a6f5-2e65650f3e9c", "3": "aee38eb9-f165-41fb-9661-0f2cf71efb1f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "aee38eb9-f165-41fb-9661-0f2cf71efb1f": {"__data__": {"text": "time scales (Cvitanovic et\u00a0al., 2018; Hobday \net\u00a0 al., 2018), and this facilitates adaptation within multiple areas \n(e.g., industries over shorter time scales, societies over longer scales) \n(Hobday et\u00a0 al., 2018). Environmental data have supported building \nsocietal and political (socio-institutional) will to adopt national and \nsubnational adaptive management principles (Hobday et\u00a0al., 2016b; \nChampion et\u00a0al., 2018; McDonald et\u00a0al., 2019). However, incorporating \nIKLK at the same time provides more diverse social\u2013environmental \ninsight (Section\u00a03.6.3.4.1; Goeldner-Gianella et\u00a0al., 2019; Petzold and \nMagnan, 2019; Wilson et\u00a0al., 2020b). This can help align adaptation \nsolutions with cultural values and increase their legitimacy with \nIndigenous and local communities (Chapter\u00a01.3.2.3), achieving climate \nresilient development pathways (Chapter\u00a018; Adger et\u00a0al., 2017; Nalau \net\u00a0al., 2018; Pe\u00f1aherrera-Palma et\u00a0al., 2018; Raymond-Yakoubian and \nDaniel, 2018; Wamsler and Brink, 2018). Second, implementation of \nmultiple low-risk options (Hoegh-Guldberg et\u00a0al., 2019a; Gattuso et\u00a0al., \n2021) such as economic diversification (Section\u00a03.6.2.1) can provide \nculturally acceptable livelihood alternatives and food supplies (e.g., \nfishing to ecotourism and mariculture) (Froehlich et\u00a0al., 2019) while also \nproviding environmental benefits (e.g., seaweed mariculture\u2019s potential \ncarbon storage co-benefits) (WGIII AR6 Chapter\u00a07; Hoegh-Guldberg \net\u00a0al., 2019a; Gattuso et\u00a0al., 2021).

Third, inclusive governance that is \nwell aligned to the systems at risk from climate change is fundamental \nfor effective adaptation (Barange et\u00a0al., 2018). Solutions implemented \nwithin polycentric governance systems (Section\u00a0 3.6.3; Bellanger \net\u00a0al., 2020) benefit from synergies between knowledge, action and \nsocial\u2013ecological contexts and stimulate governance responses at \nappropriate spatio-temporal scales (Cvitanovic and Hobday, 2018). \nGovernance aligned with Indigenous structures and local structures \nsupports successful outcomes that prioritise the concerns and rights \nof involved communities (Section\u00a03.6.3; Mawyer and Jacka, 2018) and \nbetter leverages existing social organisation (i.e., network structures), \nlearning processes and power dynamics (Barnes et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThere is an opportunity to improve current practices when developing \nnew ocean and coastal adaptation efforts so that they routinely contain \nthese successful characteristics and resolve technical, economic, \ninstitutional, geophysical, ecological and social constraints (Figure\u00a03.25; \nSection\u00a0 3.6.3.3; IPCC, 2018; Singh et\u00a0 al., 2020). Enhancements are \nneeded in human, technical and financial resources; regulatory \nframeworks (Ojwang et\u00a0 al., 2017); political support (Rosendo et\u00a0 al., \n2018); institutional conditions and resources for fair governance (Gupta \net\u00a0al., 2016; Scobie, 2018); political leadership; stakeholder engagement; \nmultidisciplinary data availability (Gopalakrishnan et\u00a0al., 2018); funding \nand public support for adaptation (Cross-Chapter\u00a0 Box\u00a0 FINANCE in \nChapter\u00a017; Ford and King, 2015); and incorporating IKLK in decision \nmaking (Nalau et\u00a0al.,", "doc_id": "95df3d3f-77e1-4a47-a147-536eafde9646", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "87e3b603f5839bf709fa65fce91bae7f61cda6f947d99cc742cbb82acbbb432c", "extra_info": {"total_pages": 172, "file_path": "./IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter03.pdf", "source": "114"}, "node_info": {"start": 6153, "end": 7918}, "relationships": {"1": "f620666c-9462-4b9f-aa54-84fafbca76ea", "2": "aee38eb9-f165-41fb-9661-0f2cf71efb1f", "3": "bd066642-1173-4bdd-bfed-f3461681472a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd066642-1173-4bdd-bfed-f3461681472a": {"__data__": {"text": "funding \nand public support for adaptation (Cross-Chapter\u00a0 Box\u00a0 FINANCE in \nChapter\u00a017; Ford and King, 2015); and incorporating IKLK in decision \nmaking (Nalau et\u00a0al., 2018; Jabali et\u00a0al., 2020; Petzold et\u00a0al., 2020).
